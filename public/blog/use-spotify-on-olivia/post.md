# Introduction

To use Spotify with Olivia, we will need to create an application which Olivia will use to play musics.

## Application
First of all, login into your account in the [Spotify dashboard page](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)
Then create a Spotify application:
<p align="center">

</p>

Enter some details about the application, its name, description
<p align="center">

</p>

Say to Spotify that it is a **non-commercial** application.
And understand the terms of service of Spotify.

You are now in your application's page.
Click on the settings button and add these **Redirect URLs**
<p align="center">

</p>

Your application is now created!

## Olivia
Since your application is created, you will need to give your tokens to Olivia.
Don't worry, she won't save them. You own your data.

In your Spotify application page, you will see your **Client ID** and a button to reveal your **Client Secret**
Copy them and give them to Olivia by saying:

> “My spotify tokens are *Client ID* and *Client Secret*”

You need to enter the Client ID **first**.

Then this window will show

</p>
You need to agree and it will redirect you to Olivia's website

You can now choose a music to play!
