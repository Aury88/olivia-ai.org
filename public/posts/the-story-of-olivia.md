Back to 2017, I had nothing to work on and my only goal was to work on a **real** project. Here is how I found the idea of making a chatbot.

I was chatting in a voice channel on Discord with my friends and I had the idea of making a chatbot that will reply with the messages of our Discord server. 
One hour later all was done, I got the messages as a looooong json file and a little script in Ruby to parse them and reply with them randomly.
I really had fun with this but I wanted something more serious.
So I started documenting about chatbots, natural language processing, machine learning and a lot of stuff that was new for me.
After weeks of documenting and testing I started to work on a prototype in Python, and it turned out that it worked well.

So I decided that the real version will be in Golang because it is the language I know best, and also because I really like Go.
The development of this version was pretty slow because I was loosing my motivation to work on Olivia but at the end I was satisfied of the work I have done.

That was the short story of how Olivia was born but another story but a new story is being written right now :)
